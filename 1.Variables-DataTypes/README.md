# Variables and Data Types

Understanding variables and data types is fundamental to programming. In this guide, we will explore what variables are, the different types of data they can hold, and how to use them effectively in your code.

## What is a Variable?

A **variable** is a symbolic name for a storage location in memory. It allows us to store and manipulate data in our programs. Variables can hold different types of values, such as numbers, text, or more complex data structures.

### Declaring a Variable

In most programming languages, declaring a variable involves specifying the variable name and the data type it will hold. Hereâ€™s an example in Python:

```python
age = 19  # Integer
name = "Manas"  # String
